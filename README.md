# Propagation Model Calculator
A Python GUI application for calculating propagation loss using various propagation models such as Okumura, Hata, Free Space, and CCIR.

# Overview
Propagation models are essential tools in the field of wireless communication and antenna design. This application provides a user-friendly interface to input parameters such as frequency, distance, transmitter height, receiver height, and select a propagation model to calculate the propagation loss.

# Features
Select from multiple propagation models including Okumura, Hata, Free Space, and CCIR.
Choose different areas (Urban, Suburban, Rural) for Hata model calculations.
Visualize propagation loss with a plotted graph.
Ability to open a PDF file containing related information.
# Usage
